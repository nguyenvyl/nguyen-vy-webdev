# Final Project: Hike Buddy
# A site that allows you to search for hikes and find users interested in the same hikes as you!

### Suggested Demo Instructions

I've put in some test users and data so you can see the full functionality of the site.

After registering for an account, try searching with the parameters Canada + Newfoundland & Labrador.
Add one of the trails that comes up. 

Then, go to your list of favorites and view one of the trails. You'll be able to see other users who have also favorited that trail, and even view their profile!

When you view their profile, you can shoot them an email asking if they'd like to go hiking. (This will open your computer's native email client.)
